Dr. Paul Gardner-Stephen  has had an interest in making computers do things they
weren't designed to do reaching back to his school years, including helping to
write LUnix, a UNIX-like preemptively multi-tasking operating system for the
Commodore 64 computer. 

At age 17 he had written software in assembly code to control a 30' industrial
roll-former for export to Brazil before moving on create software to use PCs
as hard-drives for 8-bit computers.  This software was sold on three
continents and resulted in Paul's first experience with mobile
telecommunications in the form of an NEC P3 analog cell phone in 1995. 

Soon after obtaining his doctoral degree Paul created the world's first
working and wearable shoe phone, and then made the necessary arrangements to
wear it aboard a commercial flight into US air space in the post 9-11 era to
demonstrate the increasing ubiquity of wearable computers, with a particular
focus on wireless health applications.

Along the way Paul has remained deeply involved with his local church and
supporting development and disaster response activities in a variety of
locations.

No longer content to participate remotely, he is passionate about creating
technology that can save and transform the lives of millions.

This passion has expressed itself in founding [The Serval Project](http://servalproject.org/)
, a not-for profit organisation that has created the first practical mesh
mobile telephony system.  It uses off-the-shelf cell phones, and even lets you
keep your existing phone number while making free calls on the mesh. The
Serval Project has reached the prototype stage and is expected to be trialled
in various locations from late 2011.

Paul is also teaching himself to ride a unicycle.
