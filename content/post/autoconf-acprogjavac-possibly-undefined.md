Some folks are occassionally hitting a problem where they receive an error similar to the following when they try to run autoconf on the serval-dna repository (or indeed other software):<br/>
<br/>
<span>autoconf AC_PROG_JAVAC possibly undefined macro</span><br/>
<br/>
This is extremely annoying, and doesn't really give any clues as to the cause. Â A bit of googling reveals that this can be fixed in most cases by running:<br/>
<br/>
<span><b>autoreconf -i</b></span><br/>
<br/>
Then autoconf should be able to be run without further problems.
