For the Mesh Extender we need physically very small USB memory sticks for the Rhizome data store.<br/>
<br/>
We have had problems with these in the past: some Verbatim ones wouldn't mount reliably at boot. <br/>
<br/>
So we switched to the SANDisk Cruzer Fit. <br/>
<br/>
However, those drives are not without their own problems.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, they have a really nasty habit of going permanently read-only under certain circumstances.  This is fairly well documented on the internet, and SanDisk have known about the problem for at least a couple of years, e.g.:<br/>

It turns out that one of those circumstances is when installing a Mesh Extender upgrade bundle.<br/>
<br/>
We have had two more fail within the space of an hour today, in addition to others that have failed in the past.<br/>
<br/>
We have contacted SANDisk to ask if they have fixed the root problem in their later drives, and are awaiting a response.  We have also got in touch with them to see about getting replacement drives.  We have offered to show them our use case that triggers the units to go read-only. Right now they signs aren't good that that they will sort things out, or even honour their statutory obligations, but we will keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, until SanDisk asserts and we can verify that the problem with these drives has been corrected, we strongly recommend against buying any SANDisk USB memory sticks.
