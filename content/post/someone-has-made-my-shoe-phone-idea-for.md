Some time ago, <a href="http://realshoephone.com/">I made the world's first working and wearable shoe phone</a>, and then suggested how such technology <a href="http://blogs.flinders.edu.au/flinders-news/2009/01/23/shoe-phone-offers-medical-device-potential/">might be used to support remote medical monitoring</a>, falls detection and wanderer detection, e.g., for Alheimer's suffers.  I even wound up on TV a few times, e.g.:<br/>

Anyway, a company has now made part of this vision a reality, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2146403/The-GPS-smart-shoe-track-Alzheimers-sufferers-Google-Maps-missing.html">by making a GPS-tracking shoe with a GSM modem inside</a>.  Not quite a shoe phone, but it will help to track wandering people who might otherwise have to live in supported care.</div>
