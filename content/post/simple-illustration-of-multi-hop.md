<div>From time to time I get asked to provide a simple explanation of what the Serval Project actually does.</div><div><br/>
</div><div>It allows you to make multi-hop phone calls using only phones, with the signal bouncing from phone to phone </div><div><br/>
</div><div>What does a multi-hop mobile mesh telephone call look like?  </div><div><div><br/>
Well, it can look a bit like this:</div></div><div><br/>
</div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hSTxNi9S1-w/Trno-rswPiI/AAAAAAAAAHY/m5ISoOQPWO8/s1600/09112011270.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hSTxNi9S1-w/Trno-rswPiI/AAAAAAAAAHY/m5ISoOQPWO8/s640/09112011270.jpg"/></a><div><br/>
</div><div>Of course this photo is a bit staged, and in reality the people in the middle of the call don't have to have their phones out, or do anything -- the mesh routing software automatically works out how to get the call between the parties.  <br/>
<br/>
The only limitation is that their be a path between the calling parties.</div><div><br/>
<br/>
<div>Also, the phones can be quite a bit further apart than shown here, around 100 - 200m with line of sight at present, and potentially kilometres apart once we get the ISM915 band meshing happening in the future.</div><div><br/>
</div></div><div>In a future post I will explain how we can enable SMS type services, even when there isn't a reliable path.</div>
