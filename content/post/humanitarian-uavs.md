A good friend pointed me to this blog post this morning about the use of UAVs in Humanitarian contexts:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://irevolution.net/2014/05/01/intro-to-humanitarian-uavs/">http://irevolution.net/2014/05/01/intro-to-humanitarian-uavs/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is something that we have been thinking about for a while, and talking to a few folks about, including Patrick (the author of the blog).<br/>
<br/>
We agree that Serval's store-and-forward Rhizome file distribution service seems a good fit for this kind of use case. Â It would allow UAVs to opportunistically transfer data between them while in flight whenever they were able, and similarly to opportunistically and automatically downlink data whenever in range of a suitable base station (which could just be a mobile phone someone is carrying).<br/>
<br/>
All up, this could make it very feasible to collect imagery, cellular signal strength maps and other useful data in a fairly automatic and continuous basis, especially if combined with some intelligent flight control and coordination software.
