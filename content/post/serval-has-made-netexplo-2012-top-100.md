We seemed to have reached the point with the Serval Project were we no longer have to enter competitions to start getting short-listed for things.  This is almost as amusing as it is humbling.</div>
<div>
So it is that today I discovered that we made the Nexexplo top-100 list of the latest and most proming projects.</div>

From their website, this is how they describe Netexplo:<br/>
<em><strong><br/></strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>The most promising uses of digital technology</strong></em><br/><br/><span>Every year the Netexplo global observatory of digital innovations identifies the latest and most promising projects and experiments on every continent through its international network of more than 200 spotters. This initial material, comprised of several hundred projects, companies and technologies, is then analyzed in greater depth. A college of international experts next selects the 100 most interesting cases, forming the annual Netexplo 100. </span><br/><span>Finally, a jury comprised of independent personalities from the academic world, research and international organisations elect the Grand Prix from those 10 award winners. The Grand Prix trophy is announced and given out at the Netexplo Forum.</span><br/><span>From new uses of the Web to groundbreaking technologies from research labs, as well as associations, NGOs or businesses that are transforming markets, every aspect of the ongoing digital revolution is covered. That’s why research that is still at the lab stage but has positive potential impact on lifestyles or an application that is already available can generate the same interest. Similarly, the Netexplo 100 lists futuristic applications on the verge of science-fiction alongside original, low-tech innovations using widely available technologies that deliver a socially useful function to a given audience.</span><br/>
<br/>
So thank you to the Netexplo college for thinking that we are one of the most promising projects and experiments underway in 2012.  Now all we have to do is to live up to their expectations!<br/>
