Please take a look at our crowd-funding campaign at <a href="http://igg.me/at/speakfreely">igg.me/at/speakfreely</a>.

<span>The following is a joint blog post with the New America Foundation's OTI/</span><a href="http://commotionwireless.net/">Commotion Wireless project</a><span>:</span>
<span><br/></span>
<span>On an uncharacteristically chilly May morning, members of the </span><span>Commotion and Serval projects set out for the National Mall in </span><span>Washington, DC to test Serval's latest piece of hardware: the Mesh </span><span>Extender. Commotion Wireless is an open-source toolkit of software, </span><span>documentation, and training materials that strengthens communities by </span><span>allowing them to build their own local communication infrastructure. </span><span>Serval</span><span> is a mesh networking software designed to </span><span>act as an ad hoc communications network where other infrastructure is </span><span>either absent or unavailable -- such as in remote areas or disaster </span><span>scenarios.</span><br/>

<span>Some of us stood at the Washington Monument while others were at the </span><span>Lincoln Memorial -- a distance of nearly a mile. Using two Mesh </span><span>Extenders, we successfully sent text messages and shared files between </span><span>our phones (running Serval) -- entirely independent of the cellular </span><span>infrastructure.</span><br/>

<span>On the way back to the office, we hopped on the Metro -- DC's subway </span><span>system -- to run another impromptu field test. From opposite ends of </span><span>the train, we were able to send and receive messages through six </span><span>subway cars (and their passengers) while the train was moving. That </span><span>meant we could do something Metro riders usually can't -- send and </span><span>receive messages while in the subway tunnels.</span><br/>

<span>These results represent a significant breakthrough, since until now </span><span>Serval and Commotion have been limited by the relatively short range </span><span>and low power of Wi-Fi. In addition to increasing range and power, the </span><span>Mesh Extender  removes a major obstacle to widespread adoption of mesh </span><span>for mobile phones: rooting. Normally a prerequisite for Androids to </span><span>connect to a mesh network, this technically challenging process for </span><span>installing a new operating system can cause problems down the road for </span><span>the rooted phone. In this case, the Mesh Extender routes the messages, </span><span>not the users' phones, eliminating the need for rooting.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>However, the Mesh Extender is still a prototype. Software issues make </span><span>voice calls possible but indecipherable. Further development, </span><span>including better error correction and noise cancellation, will allow </span><span>for not only voice calls but potentially even longer-distance </span><span>connections. Despite these remaining challenges, the Mesh Extender is </span><span>a huge step towards reliable decentralized infrastructure.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>A device with multiple radios and a small processor, the Mesh Extender </span><span>essentially acts as a relay between phones running Serval software. It </span><span>is lightweight, portable, and relatively cheap and easy to build. The </span><span>parts can be purchased and assembled for as little as $99. </span><span>Impressively, the battery can support three to five days of continuous </span><span>use. The Mesh Extender uses omni-directional antennas (as opposed to </span><span>point-to-point links), which make for much easier set up and</span><br/>
<span>configuration, and allow for truly mobile networks.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>The Mesh Extender operates simultaneously on the 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz </span><span>bands, both of which are unlicensed. This allows phones running Serval </span><span>to tether to the closest Mesh Extender over Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz), while the </span><span>Mesh Extenders themselves communicate over the 900 MHz band, which is </span><span>both less congested and has better propagation characteristics.</span></div>
