In previous tests of the Mesh Extenders we were manually noting the signal strength at various locations, and then drawing maps by hand to get an idea of the coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the great work by one of our students, Loïc, we now have a nice tool that lets us collect GPS traces annotated with Mesh Extender signal strength.<br/>
<br/>
Now we can collect continuous traces of signal strength very easily.  Here is one where Loïc put one Mesh Extender on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Hoist">hills hoist</a> in a suburban back-yard, and set about riding around the neighbourhood with the other Mesh Extender in his backpack to see how it performed:<br/>

<br/>
The ability to quickly deploy Mesh Extenders without great care or aiming is well illustrated in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
A map of the signal strength is visible below.  Red and brown means no link, while orange through blue is progressively stronger signal.<br/>

As in previous tests, we see coverage of a couple of hundred metres in typical suburban conditions, reaching to a radius of around ten houses, and thus covering approximately 25x - 100x as many houses as Wi-Fi.
