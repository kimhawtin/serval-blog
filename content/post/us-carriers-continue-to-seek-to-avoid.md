In the aftermath of "Super Storm Sandy", questions are being asked in the USA about carriers, their preparedness for handling emergencies and disasters, and in a subtle way, whether the carriers are willing to incur the cost of such preparations, or whether they should be free to put profit ahead of the safety of the people, and avoid as much regulation as possible.<br/>
<br/>
See, for example:<br/>

<br/>
Meanwhile, the people on the ground remain vulnerable to the whims of carriers, when they most need communications. Â This is one of the many reasons why we continue work on the <a href="http://servalproject.org/">Serval Project</a>, so that we can re-empower people to solve their own communications needs.
