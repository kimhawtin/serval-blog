Under a grant from US-AID we are in the process of adding some low-bandwidth transports to the Serval Mesh.  Ultimately, this will hopefully include Wi-Fi Direct service directory, Bluetooth Device Names, as well as using those transports directly.<br/>
<br/>
What Jeremy has achieved so far is to use Bluetooth with an automated peer discovery.  That is, if two phones running Serval Mesh have bluetooth turned on, and at least one of them is marked discoverable, then Serval Mesh on the phones will automatically create a bluetooth serial connection, and start transferring data as though it were another wireless interface, which, after all, it is.<br/>
<br/>
The following photos show Andrew and Jeremy making an authenticated, encrypted VoMP call over Bluetooth:<br/>

The in-call latency is probably around 800ms, so quite usable.<br/>
<br/>
And here we have an upside-down MeshMS conversation.  MeshMS messages deliver in just a couple of seconds if there is no other Rhizome traffic.<br/>
