Offers4U is an annoying ad-inserting thing for browsers that pops up large annoying "offer suggestions" and other junk when browsing the web (which also implies that it is taking a bit too close a look at your browsing activities..).<br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of information about how to get rid of it on Windows, however there wasn't any clear information on how to get rid of it from Chrome on a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
After a little exploration I found that it is part of the seemingly-unrelated "SafeFrom.Net helper" that claims only to be a tool to make it easier to download videos from youtube and other streaming sites.<br/>
<br/>
To get rid of it, open <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> in chrome, and then disable the SaveFrom.net helper extension.  I guess if you still want to be able download from youtube and other places (e.g., if you lost the original of a video you uploaded some time ago), then you can turn the extension on, open a new tab, and then disable it again after completing the download.<br/>
