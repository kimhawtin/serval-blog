Just a couple of quick snaps from in the lab today showing the Mesh Extender prototype with an external battery that should be sufficient to run it for 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the battery case is empty air, so it would be possible to make something even more compact.<br/>
<br/>
We might also look at making the shell of the mesh extender so that it can physically attach to a battery pack for simple one-piece operation when required, but still allow replacement with an external battery pack.<br/>

The battery pack is about the size of a Galaxy S2 phone, but 20mm thick. Â As mentioned, this could be shrunk with a better battery pack than this cheap one we bought off deal extreme.

We have since <a href="http://servalpaul.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/latest-iteration-of-mesh-extender.html">refined the prototype further, and found a smaller battery</a>.
