Over the last few years we have seen the impact and innovation that opening the software on smart phones has enabled. <br/>
<br/>
The key is that the barrier to entry is now so low, that innovation can prosper without significant drag or hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
So why don't we open the hardware on smart phones, by offering a "geek port" that some nice simple interfaces and a really cheap common connector, like a female .156" DIP header? <br/>
<br/>
The port could have some analog and digital input and output lines, and maybe a serial interface or two, perhaps the common SPI interface, and a 3.3v power rail (that the phone can turn on and off to control power consumption).<br/>
<br/>
Such a simple port would be trivial in cost to add to smart phone, probably costing less than $1 in marginal hardware cost, plus a once-of cost developing some nice APIs to access the port.<br/>
<br/>
Creating such a simple interface would allow the creation of cheap dumb devices that can plug into the port. <br/>
<br/>
Really boring stuff, like, say, a digital thermometer, an LED and sensor that can be used to collect pulse oximetry data, and relay it on an infrastructure-independent mesh network like <a href="http://servalproject.org/">servalproject.org</a>, to a local care provider.  Or maybe it might be a cheap ultrasound transponder to allow mid-wives and maternal health workers to acquire cheap ultrasound imagery. <br/>
<br/>
Each of these plug-ons could probably be made for $5 or less, and yet each has the potential to save many lives in the developing world, and save many billions of dollars in the developed world.<br/>
<br/>
And that is just in one application domain.  Who knows what else people might come up with. <br/>
<br/>
After all, no one anticipated the myriad applications that have been enabled by making smart phones programmable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div>I reckon that for perhaps $100,000 it would be possible to get a phone designed and a small manufacture run of such phones to demonstrate the idea.  Anyone want to make a significant impact on the world?</div><div><br/>
