As many readers will know, my work on the Serval Project is substantially funded by the <a href="http://shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth Foundation</a>.  They provide my income, thus freeing my time, co-investment in the project, and loads of support in a variety of ways, including a great team of other fellows and support staff.  <div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Without their support the Serval Project wouldn't be what it is.</div>
<div>

<div>
The foundation are always on the look out for other people with world changing ideas, and have released a <a href="http://vimeo.com/32908507">new explanatory video</a> that describes how their fellowship model works.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
So if you have an idea that might change the world given half a chance, then I would recommend <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/contact-us/">getting in touch with them</a>, and possibly <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/funding/fellowship-programme/">applying for a fellowship</a>.</div>
