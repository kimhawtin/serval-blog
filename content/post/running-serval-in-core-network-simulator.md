I've just been visiting the NICER project folks in Darmstadt and Marburg in Germany, where they are starting to use Serval for various parts of their research.  They have a really nice approach to the work, which is quite complementary to what we are doing.  One of the things that they have done recently is to work on simulating various Serval networks.  In the linked post below, the describe how to simulate Serval using the Core network simulator.<br/>
