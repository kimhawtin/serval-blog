A little side project we have been looking at is using Serval to support tourism activities in regional and remote Australia. <br/>
<br/>
The idea is that we want to create infrastructure-independent communications nodes at points of interest around Australia, that together we would call "The New Bush Telegraph" or "The New Overland Telegraph."  <br/>
<br/>
Each station would consist of a replica bush telegraph pole, preferably manufactured in regional Australia (more on that in a moment), that has a variant of the Mesh Extender that can serve tourist information via Wi-Fi, and be itself updated via the Serval Mesh, so that the maintenance of the system is as simple as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We had a student work on part of this earlier this year, working out what dimensions we would need for the replica insulator, so that it could fit the necessary electronics (Mesh Extender + batteries) inside, to keep them out of the weather.<br/>
<br/>
We then contracted the Pilliga Pottery to make the prototype earthenware insulators.  <a href="http://www.barkalafarmstay.com.au/pottery/">The Pilliga Pottery</a> are themselves a regional/remote Australian business, and are also the largest pottery in Australia -- so they were a natural choice for us to work with.  I had also seen some of their work during a family holiday last year, so I knew that they could do the kind of work that we were looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, while I was away in Samoa and <a href="http://www.arkaroola.com.au/">Arkaroola</a> on work trips, the prototype insulators have arrived!<br/>
<br/>
Here are our two nice boxes direct from the Pilliga Scrub (fortunately the <a href="https://shop.scholastic.com.au/Product/8055591/Three-Little-Bush-Pigs">dingrel</a> didn't get them):<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can tell it has come from regional Australia, because it is tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baling_twine">bailing twine</a>:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Finally we got down to where our new insulators were hiding:<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ex0k-yRK27E/V5VemaVj10I/AAAAAAAAF48/02UF-ncWUzs7LZEcYOeynTGzrOfiFH9UwCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160725_095149.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ex0k-yRK27E/V5VemaVj10I/AAAAAAAAF48/02UF-ncWUzs7LZEcYOeynTGzrOfiFH9UwCLcB/s400/IMG_20160725_095149.jpg"/></a>
<br/>
We had told the pottery to choose whatever colours and painting they wished, so it was a moment of surprise to see what colours they had chosen:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, it looks like they have given us three quite different and interesting colours.  This is really nice, because we want each station to be distinctive, to add a further bit of interest to the stations.  Here they all are lined up on our bench:<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErWM1Gi8xDc/V5Ven2g6arI/AAAAAAAAF5I/HVDbgoItZ6MI1v566BfvpvEHvnAXqeOJQCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160725_095720.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErWM1Gi8xDc/V5Ven2g6arI/AAAAAAAAF5I/HVDbgoItZ6MI1v566BfvpvEHvnAXqeOJQCLcB/s640/IMG_20160725_095720.jpg"/></a>
<br/>
So the next step is to get some poles, hopefully made by <a href="http://www.arrium.com/our-businesses/arrium-steel">Arrium Steelworks</a> in Whyalla, solar panels and electronics, so that we can make complete prototype units. This will be much easier once we have the new Mesh Extender prototypes, that should include solar regulators and LiFePO4 battery charger circuits (more on that in another blog post), and might need to wait until we have a student to continue to drive the project forward.
