After rather a long time, we finally have the design files for the communications tower online at:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/servalproject/foss-comms-tower">https://github.com/servalproject/foss-comms-tower</a><br/>
<br/>
We also have a paper that we will present at the <a href="http://www.ieeeghtc.org/">IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference in San Jose in October 2014</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Once the conference has been held, we will post a link to an open-access copy of the paper.  However, you can already get more detail from the thesis of Greg, the lead student on the project.  His thesis is included as a PDF in the GitHub repository mentioned above.
