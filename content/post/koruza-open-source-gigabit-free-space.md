I have previously mentioned the great work that Musti and the guys in Slovenia have been doing on open-source free-space optical links. <br/>
<br/>
Basically they use a gigabit fibre transceiver aimed through a lens in a 3D-printed enclosure to beam data over a distance of up to 100m:<br/>

<br/>
They are now looking to test their design with a number of test stations around the world.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to install one at Arkaroola in the outback, and see just how far we can make it work in the clean dry air there.<br/>
<br/>
Our good friends at <a href="http://nlnet.nl/">NLnet Foundation</a> have offered to sponsor the hardware for a node if we can get 10 organisations to sign up to the <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Innovation Network</a> (the OIN) with the reference set to "<span><span>NLNET/KORUZA"</span></span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span>The Open Innovation Network is a great idea, basically being a defensive patent pool to protection open-source projects.  The really nice thing is that you don't need any patents to join.  We signed the Serval Project up a while back (we are licensee #808).  They have some big names, like IBM and Google as members and licensees.</span><br/>
<span><br/></span>
<span>So take a look, and think about signing up your project if you would like to help us get a  chance to test one of these:</span><br/>
