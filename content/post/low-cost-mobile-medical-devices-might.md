People who know me well know that I have been talking about my desire to commoditise many medical devices by making a mobile-phone based platform that can accept a variety of medical sensors.<br/>
<br/>
The general idea is that the expensive certification can be done once for all on a common hardware platform and core libraries for acquiring, visualising, and storing signals from medical sensors. <br/>
<br/>
This would reduce the cost of developing new medical devices, and allow the same hardware to support many medical devices, driving the cost per function even lower.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking for a while about how to get the necessary hardware made, which would have entailed making a custom mobile phone and other complex and expensive things.<br/>
<br/>
However, this all looks much more possible now, thanks to a project that Google have been working on: their Project Ara:<br/>

<br/>
Ara is a modular mobile phone design, where the various parts can be easily replaced.<br/>
<br/>
This would seem to make this concept much easier to make, at least from the hardware side.
