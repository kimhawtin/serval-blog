Serval is getting involved in the IEEE 802.11ah (WiFi on ISM bands below 1GHz) to try to make sure that it is well suited to infrastructure-independent ad-hoc and mesh networking at the IEEE meeting in Okinawa next week.<br/>
<br/>
Here is our submission:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/11/11-11-1138-00-00ah-packet-radio-mode-for-802-11ah-a-b-g-n.ppt">https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/11/11-11-1138-00-00ah-packet-radio-mode-for-802-11ah-a-b-g-n.ppt</a><br/>
<br/>
Basically we are asking for two things:<br/>
<br/>
1. Improvements to ad-hoc mode (or provision of a new "packet radio" mode) that remove some of the problems currently faced when creating wifi-based ad-hoc mesh networks.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
2. That the 802.11ah standard consider speeds below 1mbit and using cell phone baseband radios as a supported transport so that even cheap cell phones can form relatively long range mesh networks without any supporting hardware.<br/>
<br/>
This second point is really important, because compared with 2.4GHz WiFi a mesh running in the ISM 915MHz band gains about +9db just from the change in frequency, which alone improves range by almost 3x. Â If it supports lower bit rates, then further significant gains are possible, e.g., allowing 100kbit communications gives another +10db, for a total of 8x range versus WiFi. <br/>
<br/>
There are some significant protocol challenges to be addressed, but if the standard doesn't support the use-case, then there will be no hardware and no chance.<br/>
<br/>
These measures have the potential to push the indoor range up from WiFi's "about one house wide" to "about a block wide" and clear line-of-sight range up to a few km, which suddenly makes the formation of suburban ad-hoc mesh networks possible, which has profound impact for creating resilient infrastructure-independent communications solutions, for example for sustaining communications during disaster or enabling communications for rural and remote or developing populations. <br/>
<br/>
We admit that we are very green to this process which we frankly find to be daunting.<br/>
<br/>
But we feel compelled to try, regardless of what we perceive to be the odds of success.
