I have been named a finalist in the South Australian Science Excellence Awards this year, which is really nice. <br/>
<br/>
You can check it out at: <a href="http://www.scienceawards.sa.gov.au/science-excellence-awards-fina/">http://www.scienceawards.sa.gov.au/science-excellence-awards-fina/</a><br/>
<br/>
In a rather surprising turn of events there are four people from the University department where I am based, not bad considering that our department is no where near 1/22 of the science output of the state.<br/>
<br/>
This year they have announced a "people's choice" award that has a basket of fine South Australian chocolates as the lure to get people to "like" the science awards facebook page.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not adverse to facebook, feel free to vote for me so that we can win the chocolate hamper and share it with our supporters.  You can vote every day until 17th August 2012 to maximise our chances of winning the hamper.
