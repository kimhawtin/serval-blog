Recently Jeremy and I attended <a href="http://rightscon.org/">RightsCon 2014</a>.  Among a variety of good things we were able to do and good people to meet with, we caught up with Miles, who has replicated our Mesh Extenders using the open documentation we have created.  While we know the documentation can always be better, it was pleasing that there was enough information for Miles to be able to replicate our work.  You can see our yellow mesh extender next to the one that Miles built himself.  Hopefully this is the first of many replications of our work.  Thanks again Miles for all your work on this and other things!<br/>
