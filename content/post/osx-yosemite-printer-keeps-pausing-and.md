If you are printing to a PaperCut server, apparently printing can have trouble from a mac running Yosemite, due to the improved security in CUPS 2.0, which is part of Yosemite.<br/>
<br/>
The interim solution is to relax the sandboxing policy in CUPS 2.0, so that it behaves like it used to. Â Of course, it would be better if PaperCut fixed the underlying problem in their software.<br/>
<br/>
The short version of what to do is:<br/>
<br/>
<code>sudo sh -c 'echo "Sandboxing Relaxed" &gt;&gt; /etc/cups/cups-files.conf'</code><br/><code>sudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd</code><br/>
<br/>
The long version can be found at:<br/>
