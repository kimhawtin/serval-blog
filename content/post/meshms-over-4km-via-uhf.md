Another short post as I try to get on top of everything at the moment to say that on our last trip to Arkaroola we successfully tested the UHF packet radio functionality over a distance of about 4km.  This was from the observatory ridge to Coulthard's Lookout. <br/>
<br/>
With the setup we were using, we had about 50% packet loss, and jet LBARD kept persevering, and delivering MeshMS messages within a minute or so.<br/>
<br/>
We did see a recurrence of a bug affecting a corner case of LBARD operation, where sometimes you have to send a 2nd message to flush out a stuck first message.  However, this should not be too hard to fix.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I fly out to Samoa to meet some folks there to talk about our AusAID / Pacific Humanitarian Challenge grant to run a pilot using Mesh Extenders there, and it will be nice to show off the UHF functionality while there.
