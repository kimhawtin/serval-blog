Today it was announced that <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nationwide-internet-blackout-in-syria/story-e6frg6n6-1226527125174">all Syria was cut off from the internet, and parts of the cellular telephone networks were shut down as well</a>. <br/>
<br/>
This is an example of a "politically induced disaster" as compared to the more familiar "naturally induced disasters", such as those resulting from bushfire or earthquake.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever anyone may think of either the Syrian government or the rebel forces, what is clear is that an entire country suffers and is made more vulnerable by this kind of act.<br/>
<br/>
It is thus suffering and vulnerability --- whatever the cause --- that the Serval Project seeks to alleviate. <br/>
<br/>
And so when we hear news like this, the response in the lab is "code more", so that we can start delivering resilient communications solutions as soon as possible.
