After various delays on various fronts, we now have in our possession enough components to assemble 40 Mesh Extenders, sufficient for the remaining activities for the Vanuatu Pilot.
<br/>
Yesterday, the RFD900+ radios, antennae and Mesh Extender PCBs arrived: <br/>

 We already had the injection-moulded housings on hand (in the boxes behind the radios and PCBs):<br/>

First step of assembly is to fit the reverse SMA bulk-head connectors to the cases, and also install the o-rings.  While not particularly glamorous, this represents some number of hours of work to do.  Karthik, a work placement student, has been placed with us over the next few months, and gets to be the lucky one to do this task:

 The first afternoon's work, we have 16 units with seals and 2 of the 3 RSMA leads in place:<br/>

After these have been all prepared, we will then proceed with getting the firmware  on the PCBs, and radios and bulk storage fitted.<br/>
<br/>
Our original plan was to use microSD cards, as they are lower power consumption than USB memory sticks, and probably handle power loss better than memory sticks.  However, there is a problem with the kernel driver for the microSD card interface, which we have yet to resolve, so we are probably going to stick with USB memory sticks for now. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately we were able to get the USB port working in the Mesh Extenders, after a bunch of earlier problems with signal integrity of the USB data traces.<br/>
<br/>
The only side effect is that we probably won't be able to reliably run these units on solar without a battery connected -- we'll find out for sure as we proceed with testing.
