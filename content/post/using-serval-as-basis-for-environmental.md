One of our developers, Corey Wallis, is in the midst of a project with some of the other researchers in the Flinders University Disaster Research Centre (DRC) where they are creating a system to acquire temperature and humidity data from mass gathering events, such as concerts and sports events. <br/>
<br/>
This involves both fixed and mobile devices with sensors continuously collecting data for analysis both at the event and on-line.<br/>
<br/>
One of the tricks is that we can't rely on cellular service being available at these events. Â Also, we want all of the field teams who are gathering data to also be able to visualise and act on the data, so we need a many-to-many distribution scheme.<br/>
<br/>
These features make it an good fit for Serval Rhizome, our store-and-forward/Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) system, that is able to handle both of these requirements, and will result in a very versatile system that can be used anywhere in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Corey has made some good progress on the hardware and software for the data gathering, as can be seen in this blog post:<br/>

<br/>
Among the next steps are to actually integrate it with the Serval Mesh software so that the data can be shared among the field teams and analysis staff.
