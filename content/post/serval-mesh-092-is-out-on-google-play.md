<div>
<span>After quite a delay, we have finally released a new version of the Serval Mesh. Â </span></div>
<div>
<span><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span>This is still an experimental release, but it does contain a number of important improvements, including but not limited to:</span></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
- The connect display has been greatly simplified, making it much easier to use, although there is still some way to go on this front.</div>
<div>
- MeshMS is now encrypted by default (and incompatible with the 0.91 and older versions of MeshMS).</div>
<div>
- Rhizome has been overhauled, and is also largely incompatible with 0.91 and older.</div>
<div>
