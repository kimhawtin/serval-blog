We have been putting some significant effort into making the Serval BatPhone software easier to build from scratch, especially first time around.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The procedure for Mac/Linux has now been reduced to (assuming you want the wifi-autodetect branch, which for now you probably do):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. <span class="Apple-style-span"><b>git clone git://github.com/servalproject/batphone.git -b wifi-autodetect</b></span><br/>
2. <span class="Apple-style-span"><b>cd batphone</b></span><br/>
3. <span class="Apple-style-span"><b>./BUILD.txt</b></span><br/>
<br/>
After that, you should be able to compile the software from in Eclipse without difficulty, as all the messy stuff has been taken care of (git sub-modules, JNI/NDK compilation, NaCl preparation, among others).<br/>
<br/>
This easy build process will be pushed up to the master branch fairly soon, but for now, it is only available with the wifi-autodetect branch.<br/>
<br/>
Note that building on Windows remains unsupported, as end of line markers in files get messed up if great care is not taken. Â If you want to build on Windows, we recommend you install a Linux virtual machine, e.g., using the free VirtualBox software, and run the build process from in there.
