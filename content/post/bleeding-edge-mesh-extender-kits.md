It has taken us much longer than we had hoped, but we finally have the Mesh Extender kits ready to post out to our generous supporters from our Indiegogo campaign.  As a token of appreciation to our long suffering supporters, we have included a pair of Serval test phones into the kits so that everything they need is there and setup for when it arrives.  Here is the contents of each kit:

I took a couple of shots during the testing of the last pair I packed this morning here at the University's new building at the Tonsley site.  Here is a Mesh Extender and test phone up on our 4th floor lab:<br/>

Then took another down to the ground floor to make sure the UHF radios still had link:<br/>

Finally, all the units were packed.  Once I have reconfirmed everyone's postal address, we will send these out.
